> The Cognitive Core for Your AI Agents - Powered by LanceDB

## 🌟 Overview

AgentVectorDB (AVDB) is a specialized memory management system developed by [Superagentic AI](https://super-agentic.ai). Built on top of LanceDB's powerful vector database capabilities, it provides optimized cognitive architecture for AI agents.

## 🤝 Built with LanceDB

We extend LanceDB's robust foundation with agent-specific features:

- Agent memory patterns
- Importance scoring
- Context management
- Cognitive state handling

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Capabilities

- **📝 Persistent Storage**: File-based, no server required
- **🔍 Semantic Search**: Efficient ANN search with filtering
- **⚡ Async Support**: High-performance async/await API
- **🎯 Agent-Optimized**: Purpose-built for AI systems

### Advanced Features

- **🔄 Memory Lifecycle**: Complete CRUD operations
- **📊 Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations
- **🧹 Smart Pruning**: Intelligent memory management
- **🔧 Flexible Schema**: Dynamic Pydantic schemas

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install agentvectordb

# With all extras (recommended)
pip install "agentvectordb[all]"

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/superagenticai/agentvectordb.git
cd agentvectordb
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from agentvectordb import AgentVectorDBStore
from agentvectordb.embeddings import DefaultTextEmbeddingFunction

# Initialize store
store = AgentVectorDBStore(db_path="./agent_db")
ef = DefaultTextEmbeddingFunction(dimension=384)

# Create collection
memories = store.get_or_create_collection(
    name="agent_memories",
    embedding_function=ef
)

# Add memories (minimum 8 recommended)
initial_memories = [
    {
        "content": "User prefers dark mode",
        "type": "preference",
        "importance_score": 0.8
    },
    # Add more memories...
]

# Add batch
memories.add_batch(initial_memories)

# Query memories
results = memories.query(
    query_text="user preferences",
    k=2
)
```
